This code snippet demonstrates a common issue in PHP: unexpected behavior with loose comparison (==) versus strict comparison (===).
```php
<?php
$a = 0;
$b = "0";
if ($a == $b) {
  echo "Loose comparison: Values are equal\n";
}
if ($a === $b) {
  echo "Strict comparison: Values are equal\n";
}
?>
```
Loose comparison checks for equality of value, while strict comparison checks for both value and type.  In this case, `0 == "0"` is true because PHP converts the string "0" to an integer 0 before comparison, but `0 === "0"` is false because they are of different types (integer and string).
This can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs if not handled carefully, especially when dealing with user input or data from external sources.
