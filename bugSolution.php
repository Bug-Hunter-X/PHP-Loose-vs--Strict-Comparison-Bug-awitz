The solution is to always use strict comparison (===) unless you explicitly intend loose comparison. This prevents unexpected type juggling and improves code reliability.
```php
<?php
$a = 0;
$b = "0";
if ($a === $b) {
  echo "Strict comparison: Values are equal (false in this case)\n";
} else {
  echo "Strict comparison: Values are NOT equal\n";
}
// Handle cases where you expect different data types differently 
if ($a == $b && gettype($a) != gettype($b)){
  echo "Loosely equal, but different types\n";
}
?>
```
By using strict comparison, the code becomes more predictable and less prone to errors caused by implicit type conversions.
